# Introduction

Laravel Apidoc is an API documentation generation tool based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). It uses Vue 2 + Element UI for frontend rendering and comes with a built-in default API documentation interface. With Laravel Apidoc, you can quickly generate the API documentation you need and also customize the documentation generation to meet your project requirements, enabling fast API documentation output.

## Why Choose Laravel Apidoc

Laravel Apidoc is designed around the following core features:

* **Clean and Beautiful Interface**: Ensures API documentation writing is simple and efficient, providing developers with a great development experience.
* **Powerful API Documentation Generation**: Easily define request and response parameters through API attributes, and output well-structured documentation.
* **Team Collaboration**: Supports internationalization, documentation management, migration, and generation to facilitate teamwork.
* **Extensibility**: Built-in customizable request and response base classes allow defining various request and response data formats.

### Team Collaboration

As projects grow larger and more people get involved, team members often struggle with inconsistent API specifications, which negatively impacts the development experience. The longer the project lasts, the more pronounced this effect becomes.

This leads us to consider whether it is possible to achieve unified frontend and backend API development by enforcing interface standards through early technical reviews.

Continuously exploring this direction, we ultimately realized this goal with Laravel Apidoc.
